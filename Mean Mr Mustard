# Purpose
Mean Mr. Mustard is an imaginatory upgrade from the Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill, after the bot was neatly destroyed in Robotica 2023. 

# Feature Wish List
Many things can be improved: 
- Upside-down drivability - might need a new shape
  - Do well with the master sketch geometry. Add ears at key places.
- Weapon motor serviceability - would be great if bottom plate can partially be removed when trying to fit a belt
  - Also need to handle an outrunner. Less need for set screws. But need to double check coupling.
  - The motor holder needs to stand rigidly. Can I add an Al bottom rail that slots /dovetails into the main rails?
- Move belt slightly away from rail, so that it doesn't have a chance to burn into it
  - Reference: Shreddit bro 2023
  - Can print my own thicker flange. Doesn't have to be delrin. 
  - Take care of belt length!!!
- Rounder rear to anti-do-the-thing without needing screws...
  - May still need some "bone" to provide frame rigidity.
- Better drive motor attachment
  - Old mounts tend to eventually pull out. Look for better methods.
  - Can use TPU on top/bottom panels to absorb impact. (Ref: Buckwild)
- Look for smaller receiver
- Smaller weapon ESC
- Add vents
  - May consider resting weapon ESC on Aluminum panel?
- Flexible fork attachments to TPU
  - Limited freedom to move down
- FT switch attachment slot

Also many new things to explore: 
- TPU wheel guard
- Try TPU top and bottom plate as well? (can switch to carrbon fiber if out of weight) (still needs threaded heat inserts for servicing)
- First try in belt drive
  - Wheels can be at either front or back. Maybe keep them at back to deal with forks.
  - In addition, this allows more room for internal arrangement
  - Needs work on:
    * Picking a shaft mechanism
    * Printing hubs
    * Chooosing belts with right length and tension
    * ?
- Better drive motors if need to save weight
- Weapon pulley guard (if possible)
