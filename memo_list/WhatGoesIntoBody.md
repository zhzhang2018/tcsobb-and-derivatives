# Stuff that goes inside main body
Created file to keep track of everything that needs to go inside the body while CAD-ing. 

Roughly sorted in size. 
- Battery 4S
- Weapon motor & its pulley
   - In addition, plan space for belt diameter and for guards.
- Drive motor x2
  - Most ones I could find are around 24mm x 24mm x 48mm if not counting shaft. 
- Weapon motor supports
- FSi6 receiver (bulky, including female connector height)
- Weapon ESC (w/ pad or w/ bullet connector)
- Drive ESC (one board or 2 separate AC ESCs)
- Battery XT connectors and/or adapters
- Wire-combining devices (rectified pads, or just ring connectors with small nuts)
- FT switch
- Wires! (~20 AWG)
