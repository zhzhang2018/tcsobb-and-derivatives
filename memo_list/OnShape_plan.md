Based on current understanding of CAD procedure (very beginner), expect to complete the following: 

1. [X] Create a general sketch of layouts
2. Roughly divide up imported parts into part studios. Each part studio only contains intra-relevant parts.
3. Create parts around the imported parts in each part studio. Use generic mate connectors as abstract "interfaces", and don't design interfaces in detail.
4. Make an assembly of the entire thing. Group stuff into subassemblies if see fit.
5. Assign weight to parts and get rough estimate of feasibility. Leave some additional weight for fasteners.
6. Order those parts (except for CNC stuff)
7. Leveraging in-context editing, work on details of interfaces. E.g. now's the time to add fastening holes on walls to host drive motor mounts.
8. Mock-up tests with spinning and srimech testing before sending off to CNC.
